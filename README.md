# MNIST

This is the 5th project of Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Tehran.

I used K-Nearest Neighbors, Desicion Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and K-Means from scikit-learn library for classifing MNIST dataset. Also, I analyzed each model and its hyperparameters and the effect of the dimensionality reduction.

In the second phase, I prepared the data using data preparation methods and classified CIFAR10 dataset images.
