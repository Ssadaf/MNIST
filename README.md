# MNIST

This is the 5th project of Artificial Intelligence course at University of Tehran.

I used K-Nearest Neighbors, Desicion Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Means models from scikit-learn library for classifing MNIST dataset. Also did analyses on each model and its hyperparameters and effect of dimensionality reduction.

In second phase did some data preparation and prediction on CIFAR10 dataset.
